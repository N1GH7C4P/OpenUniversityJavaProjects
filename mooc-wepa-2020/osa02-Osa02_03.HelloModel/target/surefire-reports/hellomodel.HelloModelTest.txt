        <h1>FullStack -työ</h1>

        <p>Once upon a time, there was a person called 
            <span>Ilkka</span>, who liked to play. As 
            <span>Ilkka</span> grew older, a small box was
            uncovered from the basement of an old abandoned house. The box had 
            the text <code>Commodore 64</code> written on it --
            <span>Ilkka</span> found the box very 
            interesting, but did not know what to do with it.</p>

        <p>To unravel the mystery, <span>Ilkka</span> 
            sought out the owners of the house, and asked them about the box. 
            They told that it is a sacred relic from ancient times, when people 
            could conjure things with their hands.</p>

        <p>"<em>Why have I not heard about this before</em>", asked 
            <span>Ilkka</span>. "<em>The things that the
                owners of such relics have conjured are all around us, but we 
                do not see them anymore as the people from ancient times used 
                to see them</em>", answered one of the owners. "<em>They are 
                as much a part of us, as  we are a part of them, hidden in our 
                midst</em>", continued the other.</p>

        <p>How can something be hidden, but still be there, 
            <span>Ilkka</span> could not understand. And 
            so, the journey began.</p>
